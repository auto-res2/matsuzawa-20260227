# Comparative baseline 0: Zero-shot direct (no CoT, single call)
run_id: comparative-0-gsm8k

# [VALIDATOR FIX - Attempt 1]
# [PROBLEM]: Low accuracy (0.1) due to model not outputting clean numeric answers
# [CAUSE]: Weak prompt allows model to include explanatory text or multiple numbers
# [FIX]: Strengthened prompt with explicit format instruction and example

#   name: "Zero-shot Direct"
#   description: "Single call, direct answer without explicit reasoning"
#   max_calls: 1
#   prompt: "Answer the following question with only the final numeric answer, no explanation:"
