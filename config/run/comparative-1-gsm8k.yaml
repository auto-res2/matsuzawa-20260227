# Comparative baseline 1: Standard hidden CoT (single call)
run_id: comparative-1-gsm8k

# [VALIDATOR FIX - Attempt 2]
# [PROBLEM]: Model outputs full text explanations instead of just numeric answers
# [CAUSE]: Prompt instruction is not strong enough; model ignores "output only" instruction and shows reasoning
# [FIX]: Changed to extremely direct prompt that demands only a number in response format
#
# [OLD CODE]:
# method:
#   type: hidden_cot
#   name: "Hidden CoT"
#   description: "Single call with hidden chain-of-thought instruction"
#   max_calls: 1
#   prompt: "Think step-by-step internally to solve this problem. Then output ONLY a single number as your final answer - no words, explanations, units, or labels.\n\nQuestion:"
#
# [NEW CODE]:
method:
  type: hidden_cot
  name: "Hidden CoT"
  description: "Single call with hidden chain-of-thought instruction"
  max_calls: 1
  prompt: "Answer with ONLY a number. No words, explanations, or units - just the number."
