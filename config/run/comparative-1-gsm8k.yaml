# Comparative baseline 1: Standard hidden CoT (single call)
run_id: comparative-1-gsm8k

# [VALIDATOR FIX - Attempt 5]
# [PROBLEM]: Accuracy only 33.5% because max_tokens=20 prevents chain-of-thought reasoning
# [CAUSE]: Previous fix over-constrained tokens; "hidden CoT" needs reasoning space, then extract final answer
# [FIX]: Increase max_tokens to 300 for brief reasoning; update prompt to format "Answer: X"; extract last number
#
# [OLD CODE]:
# method:
#   type: hidden_cot
#   name: "Hidden CoT"
#   description: "Single call with hidden chain-of-thought instruction"
#   max_calls: 1
#   prompt: "Solve the following problem and output ONLY the final numeric answer. Do not include any words, explanations, steps, or units. Output ONLY the number.\n\nQuestion:"
#
# [NEW CODE]:
method:
  type: hidden_cot
  name: "Hidden CoT"
  description: "Single call with hidden chain-of-thought instruction"
  max_calls: 1
  prompt: "Solve this problem step-by-step, then provide your final answer as 'Answer: [number]'.\n\nQuestion:"

# [VALIDATOR FIX - Attempt 5]
# [PROBLEM]: max_tokens=20 prevents chain-of-thought reasoning entirely
# [CAUSE]: "Hidden CoT" should allow reasoning but extract only final answer; 20 tokens allows no reasoning
# [FIX]: Increased max_tokens to 300 for brief CoT reasoning + final answer

# [OLD CODE]:
# model:
#   provider: openai

#   max_tokens: 20  # Constrain to number-only output (GSM8K answers are short numbers)
#
# [NEW CODE]:
model:
  provider: openai
  model_name: gpt-4o-mini
  temperature: 0.0
  max_tokens: 300  # Allow space for brief chain-of-thought reasoning + final answer
