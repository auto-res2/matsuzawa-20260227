# Comparative baseline 1: Standard hidden CoT (single call)
run_id: comparative-1-gsm8k

# [VALIDATOR FIX - Attempt 1]
# [PROBLEM]: Model may not output clean numeric answers consistently
# [CAUSE]: Prompt could be clearer about output format
# [FIX]: Strengthened output format instruction while keeping CoT instruction
#
# [OLD CODE]:
# method:
#   type: hidden_cot
#   name: "Hidden CoT"
#   description: "Single call with hidden chain-of-thought instruction"
#   max_calls: 1
#   prompt: "Think step-by-step internally, then output only the final numeric answer:"
#
# [NEW CODE]:
method:
  type: hidden_cot
  name: "Hidden CoT"
  description: "Single call with hidden chain-of-thought instruction"
  max_calls: 1
  prompt: "Think step-by-step internally to solve this problem. Then output ONLY a single number as your final answer - no words, explanations, units, or labels.\n\nQuestion:"
