  stability_probe_edit: "Solve by writing equations first, then output only the final numeric answer."
  repair_prompt: "Two attempts gave different answers: {answer1} and {answer2}. Perform a constraint check (units, parity, monotonicity, substitution) and output only the correct final numeric answer."
